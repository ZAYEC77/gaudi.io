    <h1>Why gaudi ?</h1>

    <p>
        Provisioning and orchestration can be painful for a developer with no system administration knowledge.<br /><br />
        With orchestrator like Chef or Puppet, you have to find the good module and learn how to make them work together.<br/>
        Gaudi is build on top of <a href="https://www.docker.io">Docker</a>. It can run each component of your architecture in a container.<br />
        Each container are isolated and can communicate when they are linked.<br /><br />

        Gaudi allows to configure each component individually, depending of they type.<br />
        In this way you can configure where to redirect PHP request in a Nginx component, using replication with MySQL container, etc...
